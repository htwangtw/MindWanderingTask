Welcome to our experiment.

In it you will be asked to attend to pairs of different shapes, divided by a coloured vertical line in the middle of the screen.
The vertical line will always be BLUE or RED to indicate whether you are in the BLUE condition or RED condition.
On screens where shapes are coloured BLACK you will only be required to keep your eyes in the centre of the screen and attend to the shapes.

Depending on the condition when you are presented with a target you must indicate 
In BLUE CONDITION which side the target shape is on CURRENTLY
In RED CONDITION which side the target shape was on PREVIOUSLY 
The left arrow button indicates LEFT.
The right arrow button indicates RIGHT.
