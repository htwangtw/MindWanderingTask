# MindWanderingTask
The mind-wandering task used at the Mind-wandering lab in University of York.

This paradigm still has a lot to be improved therefore I separated it from the lab toolkit for the ease of coolaboration and amandement. 

Documentation coming soon. 


##Recent update: 22082016	
	Fixed stimList variable typo. 
	This problem has led to incorrect accuracy judgement in the 0-back task. 
	However, every dispy has been recoreded and can recover the correct accuracy rate by checking the display on go trials.
